# Meet Auto Leave
Chrome extension that automates your Google Meet experience. It enables automatic joining and leaving of meetings based on schedules, timers, or participant counts. Users can set links and times for auto-join, exit when participant numbers drop below a minimum or a percentage of the peak, send automatic chat messages ("Hello" on join, "See you" on exit), and mirror reactions when a set number of participants use the same emoji. Meet Auto Leave streamlines virtual meetings with a user-friendly interface and secure, minimal permissions.
